# Project Overview

In this project, I generated my own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. I was using a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network that I build generated a new, "fake" TV script.
## Framework Used

*Pytorch

## TRAINING PROCESS

Used the GPU for training which supports cuda and tuned the hyperparameters accordingly.

##Sample generated script:
```
jerry:

jerry: i can't believe you didn't say anything.

george: no.

kramer: hey, hey!

elaine:(quietly) i was just trying to get out of here.

george: well, i'm sure you should be able to go to the hospital.

jerry: well, what is it about?

elaine: well, i just came from my office to the office and i didn't have any money.

jerry: i know.

george: i can't do it.

jerry: i know.

jerry: i can't. i think you could just get it out.

kramer: well, it's not that you.

kramer: oh, no. no, no. i think it's a good idea.

kramer: well, you know the one that was in the hall.

george: i can't believe it!

jerry: i don't know.

kramer: oh, well, you know, i have a little nervous.

elaine: well, i don't know if you want to talk about the whole thing.

george: well, i guess i got the car.(to the phone) hey, you know what? i'm sorry about it.

jerry: i think i could get a little..

george: what?

kramer: yeah, well, i'm sorry. i'm sure i'm not really going to do something about it.

george: i think you can just tell me about it.

elaine:(pointing to her) i don't know what you said to him.

jerry: i know, but you have a good job.

george: i know i don't know. i know.

jerry:(pointing) you know what the hell do you say?

elaine: i think it's a good word.

jerry: yeah, i guess.

kramer:(to jerry) well, you know, i was gonna have to be honest with him.

jerry:(to george) hey!
```

## What did I do?
Downloaded the data and the notebook with the outline and basic tests.   
I implemented data loading and pre-processing as well as the RNN network. 
At the end I provided the Starting character from which the dialogues start taking place.
